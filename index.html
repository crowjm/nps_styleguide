			<p>Wallace Stegner referred to the National Parks as "America's Best Idea." The idea of the Park Service began in the mid 1800s, when President Lincoln signed a law preserving Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove. In 1872, Congress established Yellowstone National Park, and in 1916 President Wilson established the National Park Service. Great Smoky Mountain National Park was chartered in 1934 and established in 1940 and is the most visited National Park.</p>
			<p>One of the main problems the NPS is facing is that people who visit the Parks are primarily old and white, and their website isn't doing everything that it can to serve as a solution to this problem.</p>
			<p>Their website currently feels exclusive and limited in terms of audience (both groups have links in the header that lead to special content). Keeping this part of the audience is important, but I also expanded to include millenials.</p>
			<p>The website also feels antiquated and you have to dig on the website to find pictures that show the beauty and power of the parks.</p>
			<p>Perhaps the biggest problem with their website is that it isn't cohesive with their social media presence. On social media channels, NPS feels youthful, exciting, and still retains the trustworthy feel a government branch should have. Their website does not reflect this.</p>
			<p>My goals for this project were to make the NPS &amp; Smokies website have a more modern feel that appeals to millenials and also streamline the vibe of their social presence with their website. I also wanted to create a cohesive design system that could be applied to all Parks within the NPS system.</p>
